# Console-app
This is a C++ application that verifies the flight tickets that the user has bought on the desktop app. 

The app communicates with the database app through an API and requires an internet connection to function. The app scans the barcode generated by our mobile app and displays the ticket details, such as the flight number, departure and arrival locations, airline, departure time, and boarding status. 

The app is fast, accurate, and easy to use.
